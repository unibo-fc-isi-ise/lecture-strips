\begin{itemize}
	\item STRIPS is the very first successful attempt of building a Planner
\end{itemize}

%\vfill

\begin{block}{Automatic planner \textit{(recall)}}
    An \alert{automatic planner} is an algorithm accepting as input
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] a representation of some \alert{initial state},
		\item[(ii)] a \emph{set} of possible \alert{actions},
		\item[(iii)] a \alert{goal}, that is, a compact description of a target state,
	\end{itemize}
	and producing a \alert{plan} as output, that is, a \emph{sequence} or \emph{directed graph} of actions leading the described system from the initial to the target state

\end{block}

\vfill

\begin{block}{STRIPS}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[+] action, world, and goal \alert{representation languages}
		%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item simpler -- thus less expressive -- than the situation calculus
			\item no frame problem
		\end{itemize}
		%
		\item[+] \alert{regression} planning $\implies$ \alert{backward} algorithm for building plans
		%
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item search occurs on the \alert{state space}
			\item backward $\approx$ starting from the goal, move towards the initial goal
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{STRIPS in a Nutshell}

In STRIPS \ldots

\begin{block}{How are \aalert{states} represented?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a state $S = \{ f_1, \ldots, f_n\}$ is a \alert{set} of \alert{fluents} $f_i$
		\item each fluent $f$ is a \emph{ground} logic \alert{fact} which is true in that state
		\item CWA: only what is \emph{explicitly} stated, is true
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{How are \aalert{goals} represented?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a goal $S = \{ f_1, \ldots, f_m\}$ is a \alert{(sub-)set} of \alert{fluents} $f_j$
		\item every fluent in the goal must be \alert{included} in a state, for the goal to hold in that state
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[i.e.] $G \text{ holds in } S \Leftrightarrow G \subseteq S$
		\end{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] Goal testing $\equiv$ Set inclusion
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[$\rightarrow$] no entailment notion $\rightarrow$ less computational effort, less expressivity
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\framebreak

\begin{block}{How are \aalert{actions} represented?}
	An action $\alpha$ is a quartet $\langle N, P, A, D \rangle$, where
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$N$] is the action name
		\item[$P$] is a set of fluents, representing \alert{pre}-conditions
		\item[$A$] is a set of fluents, representing \alert{positive post}-conditions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a.k.a.\ $A$dd List
		\end{itemize}
		\item[$D$] is a set of fluents, representing \alert{negative post}-conditions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a.k.a. $D$elete List, or Remove List
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{STRIPS assumption}
	What is \textbf{not} specified in $A$ or $D$ remains unchanged
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\rightarrow$] no frame problem!
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{block}{First-order logic (FOL)}
	Fluents and action names in STRIPS are FOL \alert{terms}, subject to the following constraints:
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item states can only contain \alert{ground} terms
		\item gaols and action names may contain \alert{variables}
		\item variables contained in an action name $N$ can occur in fluents from $P$, $A$, or $D$ too
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\framebreak

\begin{block}{Action applicability}
	An action $\alpha = \langle N, P, A, D \rangle$ is \alert{applicable} to some state $S$ if and only if there exists some $S' \subseteq S$ such that:
	%
	\begin{center}
		$mgu(S', P) = \theta$
	\end{center}
	%
%	where $mgu$ is the \emph{most general unifier} function, returning a substitution $\theta$ which can make $P$ equals to $S'$ when applied to $P$.
	%
	which implies $P \theta \subseteq S$.
\end{block}
%
\begin{itemize}
	%
	\item there, $mgu$ is the \emph{most general unifier} function, returning a substitution $\theta$ which can make $P$ equals to $S'$ when applied to $P$.
	%
	\item roughly speaking, $mgu(S', P) = \theta$ can be read as ``$P$ unifies with $S'$''
	%
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Action application}
	Assuming some action $\alpha = \langle N, P, A, D \rangle$ is applicable to some state $S_1$ through $\theta$, it can be applied to $S_1$ by means of the following function:
	\begin{center}
	 	$apply(S_1, \alpha) = S_2 = \alert{(S_1 - D \theta) \cup A \theta} $
	\end{center}
	which, essentially, formally describes the STRIPS assumption

		%
		which succeeds in computing the novel state \prolog{NewState} only if the action named \prolog{ActionName} is applicable to \prolog{State}

		\item set comparisons %(general signature: \prolog{<rule name>(+Set1, +Set2)})

			\item \prolog{apply([ontable(a),clear(b),on(b,a),handempty],unstack(b,X),S)}
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item produces \prolog{S / [ontable(a), clear(a), holding(a)]}
			\end{itemize}

			\item \prolog{apply([ontable(a),clear(b),on(b, a),handempty],stack(b,X),S)}
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item fails
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Testing Your Code}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item you can test your \texttt{apply/3} implementation against the actions you defined, say, into \texttt{BlockWorld.pl}, by uncommenting the line
		%
		\clicmd{world=\alert{BlockWorld}}
		%
		within \texttt{gradle.properties} file

		\vfill

		\item then, you can start a Prolog REPL by running
		%
		\clicmd{./gradlew :strips:run}
		%
		and then provide your \emph{dot-terminated} queries through \texttt{stdin}

		\vfill

		\item similarly, you can test other action files by changing the value of the \texttt{world} property in \texttt{gradle.properties}

		\vfill

		\item remember to restart your REPL if you edit any \texttt{.pl} file

    Repeat until $Stack$ is empty. Let $H$ the head of the $Stack$:
    %
    % At each step, the action performed by the algorithm depends on the stack's head, $H$:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $H$ unifies through $\theta$ with some fluent $F$ in the current $State$:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item then $H$ is popped and $\theta$ is applied to $Stack$'s tail
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item if $H$ matches some \alert{positive} post-condition $A$ of some action named $N$:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item then $H$ is popped, $N$ is pushed, as well as $pre(N)$
            \item and $\theta = mgu(H, A)$ is applied to $Stack$
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item if $H$ matches some conjunction of goals $G_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge G_m$:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item then the conjuction is popped
            \item and each $G_i$, for $i \in \{1,\ldots,m\}$ is pushed on the stack
            \item the ordering of such pushings is arbitrary
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item if $H$ matches some action name:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item then $H$ is applied to $State$ and $State$ is updated accordingly
            \item furthermore, $H$ is pushed into $Plan$
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item otherwise, no plan can be computed and $\varnothing$ is returned
    \end{enumerate}

    \vfill

    When $Stack$ is empty, $reverse(Plan)$ is returned

\subsection{Discussion}

\begin{frame}[c]{Choice Points do Matter -- Example}

The STRIPS algorithm may diverge in several situations, e.g.:
%
\vfill
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item an \alert{\emph{idempotent}} sequence of actions may be selected an unlimited amount of times:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[eg] \texttt{[}\plil{stack(a,b), unstack(a,b), stack(a,b), unstack(a,b),} \ldots
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill

    \item an action which is always applicable, is combined with some trivial action selection strategy, like, e.g. Prolog's top-first\footnote{the example assumes the expressions \texttt{X+1} and \texttt{X-1} are \alert{evalued} in actions' post-conditions---which is not actually the case in the current Prolog implementation}
    \begin{itemize}\scriptsize
        \item[eg] \plil{action(inc(R), if([reg(R, X)]), '+'([reg(R, X+1)]), '-'([reg(R, X)])).}
        \\
        \plil{action(dec(R), if([reg(R, X)]), '+'([reg(R, X-1)]), '-'([reg(R, X)])).}

        \item[]

        \item[?-] \plil{strips([reg(r1, 0)], [reg(r1, -1)], Plan).}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Algorithm}

\begin{frame}[c]{Implementing STRIPS in Prolog I}

    \begin{block}{Exercise 3}
        Complete the \prolog{strips_impl/6} predicate in \texttt{Strips.pl}
    \end{block}
	%
	\lstinputlisting[style=Prolog-cool,basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily]{./listings/strips_impl.txt}
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item where is the stack?
        \item what is the purpose of the \prolog{BadActions}\footnote{$4^{th}$ argument in \texttt{strips\_impl/6}} set?
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Implementing STRIPS in Prolog II}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Perform some simple testing}
        \lstinputlisting[frame=none,style=Prolog-cool,basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]{./listings/StripsTests2.txt}
    \end{exampleblock}

    \vfill

    \begin{alertblock}{Important Notice}
        \begin{itemize}

            \item notice that a correct implementation of the \prolog{strips/3} predicate should enumerate all possible plans

            \item Depending on your implementation, the firstly produced solution may differ from the teacher's one
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                \item in that case, just ensure the provided solution makes sense
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{alertblock}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search}

\begin{frame}[c]{About the \texttt{BadActions} Trick}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item the \prolog{BadActions} set is a smart trick aimed at avoiding Prolog's \alert{depth-first} search strategy always selects the same action

        \vfill

        \item without such trick, the Prolog engine may enter in some (possibly \alert{infinite}) loop, where the same action is selected several times

        \vfill

        \item sadly, the trick \alert{cuts off} all plans where two consecutive and equals actions are actually desired, like for instance:
        %
        \lstinputlisting[style=Prolog-cool,basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]{./listings/Registers.txt}
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search (IDDFS)}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item how can we edit our STRIPS implementation, letting it find \alert{all} good solutions while avoiding infinite loops?
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item recall that planning is essentially a sort of \alert{search} problem
            \item recall that Prolog essentially leverages on a \alert{depth-first} search
            \item IDDFS is the best \alert{uninformed} search strategy, when the solution depth is unknown and the tree max depth is unbounded
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{STRIPS + IDDFS + Prolog = Exercise}

	\begin{block}{Exercise 4}
		Edit the \prolog{strips/3} and \prolog{strips_impl/6} rules in \texttt{Strips.pl} in such a way that your STRIPS implementation performs an IDDFS for plans, up to \prolog{max_depth(MD)}
		%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item assume \prolog{max_depth(MD)} is part of your theory
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the value of \prolog{MD} actually coincides with the value of the \texttt{maxDepth} entry in \texttt{gradle.properties}
			\end{itemize}

			\item test it against the \texttt{Registers.pl} world

			\item notice that the \prolog{BadActions} tricks should became useless
		\end{itemize}
